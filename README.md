# Storytool
## The mission
The goal is to create a tool to help storymakers to write branching and complex stories.

This project is currently under development and the list below may change during development.
I am sorry,  but in the GitHub Preview is the following list unsatisfying, since each Feature has a unique number.

## Planned Features
1 Storylines (You can write the script)

2 Tree View (Flowchart)

4 Branching

5 Multiple Graphs per Project

6 Connections between graphs

8 Nodesets connected to characters

12 Export Graphs to PNG and HTML/MD/TXT (real script)

13 Team Collaboration

14 Data saved as to be created XML based file format

15 Simulation/Debug mode (Playing of the story, to find dead ends and logical issues)

## In Progress
3 Nodes

16 Graphs

17 Input Handling (Selecting of Nodes, moving, etc..)



## To be improved (Done first stage)
11 Scriptlanguage to activate a node only based on the script (complex conditions, adding values to global variables, ...)

18 Global Variables Window

7 Global Variables to save Stats
